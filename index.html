      <h2>Start Here</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Thelonious Junk</p>
      <p>The goal of this site is simple:</p>
      <p>
        To provide an escape from the sterile mainstream mediocrity that is
        consuming the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to show you the <em>"Junk",</em> not the sanitized, curated,
        censored vanilla that the world consumes, but the unconventional, dirty
        bits that lie underneath it allâ€”the discarded remnants, the forgotten
        voices, the unconventional perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the day and age of doom-scrolling, vanilla algorithmic feed curation,
        cable television, and self-help, people are not exposed to profound
        ideas and the amazing things awaiting their discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through a curated selection of writings, films, music, and discourse, I
        invite you to embark on a journey into the unknown, where every
        encounter is an opportunity to expand your mind, challenge your beliefs,
        and awaken your senses to the richness and complexity of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want Thelonious Junk to provide a direct IV of alternate perspectives
        and exposure to the unconventional ways of the world
      </p>
      <p>
        Meet interesting people, listen to stimulating arguments, watch
        inspiring films, and hear different music.
      </p>
      <p>Here at Thelonious Junk, I want to expose you to the best "Junk."</p>
